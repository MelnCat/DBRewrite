Bot Config setup:
- Go to the config directory Then,

- Copy the config.hsjon.example file Then rename it to just
"config.hsjson" Then, go into the file put your token into the "" Then,
- Your main server ID is put into the "" Then,
- For your Database URL keep the first line the same, like this - postgresql://Username:password@localhost:5432/DBName?schema=public Then,
- make sure you include the 2 emoji ids!
Next,  

Starting the bot:
Run These commands: Might only need to run these once Before Starting the bot
- "yarn prisma:generate" // You'll need to Do this After you edit the schema.prisma File
- "yarn prisma:push" // You'll use this to make the Database you defined Before startup
Then,
- To start the bot go to the dist directory and start "index.js" with pm2

Extra:
And, use "node genenv" To generate something
In the prisma Directory Open up the schema.prisma With VSC (or any type of editor you use)

Keep everything default But, under the provider = prisma-client-js
Put binaryTargets ["native", "Type"]

You'll get an error Anyways So you'll know what to Replace the "type" with
Then, load up the bot and see if you get any errors!

If you want to go into Production mode/ Back to development Mode Use the a ecosystem file: 

TEMPLATE:
``
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: "DBRewrite",
    script: "node dist",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "development",
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    }
  }]
}

``
Commands: (Use the Production Command for global commands) To Restart replace start with restart
 
- start pm2 ecosystem.config.js --env production
- start pm2 ecosystem.config.js --env development
